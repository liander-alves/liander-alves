    Was previously an Portfolio Management intern at <a href="https://www.gov.br/aeb/">Brazilian Space Agency</a>

<p>
I'm also pursuing a dual degree in electronics engineering &#9889;
</p>
<p>
My interests currently are flight control systems, embedded systems, high performance computing and software development.

Since I spend most of my time in projects that are not open-source, all my repositories are currently private.
I have plans to revamp some projects I did as assignments and upload them here as soon as i have time to do it :)

<em><b>I really like learning new things from people</b> so if you want to reach out and say hi, I'll be glad to interact!</em>
